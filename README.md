**smart-spider-project**

The repository cointains all my spider programs.

My smart-spider project is a component of my engine project.

**Recommendation**
The image_miner works very well. 

It sould be used if you only want to exract images based on search queries.

The media_spider works very well also and is the latest version it still has a bug in the link instraction process. 

You should tweak the RELAX_TIME so you are not kicked out for scrap abuse.

**LAST UPDATE**
- media_spider.py is your best choice

I integrated a fake_useragent and proxy functionality
I also integration proxy and rotating proxy functionality

**smart-spider**

Smart spider will be less dump it's a promise.

The spider will be able to extract and evaluate web site content in a more elegant way.

The program is too large and must be redesigned in a better way.
