Smart-spiders

Well smart is maybe too strong a definition.
Let's say its not dumb.

It chooses the path depending on the keyword found in the URL.
It has some other features in some intelligence...

The image_miner_2.0 works very well and you should tweak the Relax score so you are not kicked out for scrap abuse.

The media_url_spider is still in developpement.
smart_spider_2.0 works well for scrapping.

URL, IMAGE, MEDIA, DATA

Smart spider 3.0 will be less dump its a promise.
He will be able to extracts, classifies and evaluates web site content.
