smart-spider-3.0 

Smart is maybe too strong a definition. Let's say its not dumb. It chooses the path depending on the keyword found in the URL. It has some more features and some intelligence...

The image_miner_2.0 works very well. 

It can extract image based on keywords.   

It works very well and you should tweak the RELAX_TIME so you are not kicked out for scrap abuse.

I put use 

LAST UPDATE

- media_spider.py is your best choice
  
Smart spider 3.1 will be less dump it's a promise.

The spider will be able to extracts and evaluates web site content in a more elegante way.
