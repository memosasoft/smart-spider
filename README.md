smart-spider-3.0

Smart is maybe too strong a definition. Let's say its not dumb. It chooses the path depending on the keyword found in the URL. It has some more features and some intelligence. 

My smart-spider project is a component of a search my engine project. I am still exploring 
possibilities. But more intelligence will be added in the futur.

**Recommendation**
The image_miner_2.0 works very well. It sould be used if you only want to exract images
based on search queries.

The media_spider works very well also and is the latest version. 

You should tweak the RELAX_TIME so you are not kicked out for scrap abuse.

**LAST UPDATE**
- media_spider.py is your best choice

I integrated a fake_useragent and proxy functionality
I also integration proxy and rotating proxy functionality

**smart-spider-3.1**

Smart spider 3.1 will be less dump it's a promise.

The spider will be able to extract and evaluate web site content in a more elegant way.
The program is too large and must be redesigned in a better way.
